=====================================================================

HarvesterDroid is intended to be a simple resource tracking and management tool for Star Wars Galaxies. The core goal of HarvesterDroid is to obtain the latest resources and compare them across your stashed inventory resources. In the end, HarvesterDroid has been programmed from the ground up to be easily modified for tracking from multiple resource websites that provide XML exports.

I started on this project almost a year ago and it is fairly complete for the most part to work with GalaxyHarvester. There isn't much more refactoring that needs to be done in order for it to work with other sites such as SWGCraft

Programmed with love by Waverunner <3

#### Features
* Track resources based on their best weight from a schematic
* Easily organize your schematics with groups
* Display the best obtainable resources for a schematic
* Keep track of your top resources through the inventory

### Future
* Finalize support for use with other resource tracking websites (50% done!)
* Server selection
* Update Getting Started images

# Getting Started
Using HarvesterDroid is super easy! First off we start by creating a schematic.

Define the resources that you want to track for this schematic and their properties.

Tip: Take advantage of groups by creating a group for each profession and use a schematic to track resources of interest for that profession

Select the schematic you created, if there's resources that are harvestable (or in your inventory!) they'll show up in the Best Resources window

Have a better resource? No problem, lets add it to our inventory by selecting the Add button under the Inventory window. Now just type in the name and retrieve the stats and let HarvesterDroid do its magic.

Just started harvesting a resource and want HarvesterDroid to remember it when it despawns? Select the resource in the Best Resources panel and click on the Add button under your inventory. It's easy as that! Also, don't forget to save by going to File -> Save. HarvesterDroid will automatically save when it closes, but better to be safe than sorry.

Preferences are saved to your local user folder under the name ".harvester", you might need to enable hidden file names in order to see them.
