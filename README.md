========================

HarvesterDroid is intended to be a simple resource tracking and management tool for Star Wars Galaxies. The core goal of HarvesterDroid is to obtain the latest resources and compare them across your stashed inventory resources. In the end, HarvesterDroid has been programmed from the ground up to be easily modified for tracking from multiple resource websites that provide XML exports.

Programmed with love by Waverunner
## Features
* Track resources based on their best weight from a schematic
* Easily organize your schematics with groups
* Display the best obtainable resources for a schematic, from active to despawned resources
* Keep track of resources with an inventory!

# Getting Started
Using HarvesterDroid is super easy! First off we start by creating a schematic.

Define the properties that you want to track for this schematic.

Tip: Take advantage of groups by creating a group for each profession and use a schematic to track resources of interest for that profession

Select the schematic you created, if there's resources that are harvestable they'll show up in the Best Resources window

Have a better resource? No problem, lets add it to our inventory by selecting the Add button under the Inventory window. Now just type in the name and retrieve the stats and let HarvesterDroid do its magic.

Just started harvesting a resource and want HarvesterDroid to remember it when it despawns? Select the resource in the Best Resources panel and click on the Add button under your inventory. It's easy as that!

Lets not forget to save by clicking the Save button. HarvesterDroid will automatically save when it closes, but better to be safe than sorry.
