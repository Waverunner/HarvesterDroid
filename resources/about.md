HarvesterDroid is intended to be a simple resource tracking and management tool for Star Wars Galaxies. The core goal of HarvesterDroid is to obtain the latest resources and compare them across your stashed inventory resources. In the end, HarvesterDroid has been programmed from the ground up to be easily modified for tracking from multiple resource websites that provide XML exports.

I started on this project almost a year ago and it is fairly complete for the most part to work with GalaxyHarvester. There isn't much more refactoring that needs to be done in order for it to work with other sites such as SWGCraft
